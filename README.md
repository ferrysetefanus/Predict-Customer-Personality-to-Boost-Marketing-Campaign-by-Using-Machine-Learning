# Predict-Customer-Personality-to-Boost-Marketing-Campaign-by-Using-Machine-Learning
In this Mini Project, I acted as a Data Scientist in a company as the core Data Science Team. I am given the responsibility to process historical marketing campaign data to improve performance and target the right customers to transact on the company's platform. Here I learned how to process data, clean data, create machine learning models, and draw conclusions and business insights that can be recommended regarding the current marketing campaign. Some of the stages carried out in this mini project are: 
- Conversion rate analysis based on income, spending and age.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Data Modeling
- Customer personality analysis for marketing retargeting.
